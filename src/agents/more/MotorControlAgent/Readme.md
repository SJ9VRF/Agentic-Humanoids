Inverse Kinematics:
- Simplified computation based on target position and orientation.
  
Dynamic Balance Control:
- Implements simulated balance corrections based on the center of mass.
  
Trajectory Execution:
- Handles multi-waypoint trajectories seamlessly.
  
Joint Limit Handling:
- Ensures joint angles stay within predefined limits.
  
Error Handling:

### Extensions
Integration with Real Hardware:
- Replace simulated methods with actual robotic hardware drivers using ROS, MoveIt!, or similar frameworks.

Advanced Control Models:
- Use predictive control models (e.g., MPC) for precise trajectory optimization.

Error Recovery:
- Implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies for failed movements.

Environment Interaction:
- Add collision detection and avoidance during movement execution.
