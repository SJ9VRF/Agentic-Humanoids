Inverse Kinematics:
- Computes the joint angles required for the robot to reach a given target position and orientation.
- Implementation simulates the computation; replaceable with libraries like KDL or PyBullet.
- Simplified computation based on target position and orientation.
 
Dynamic Balance Control:
- Ensures the robot maintains stability during movement using models like Zero Moment Point (ZMP) or Center of Mass (COM).
- Implements simulated balance corrections based on the center of mass.

Trajectory Execution:
- Handles multi-waypoint motion by iterating through a trajectory of target positions and orientations.

Real-Time Feedback:
- Logs progress and errors in each step of motion planning and execution.

Extensibility:
- Ready for integration with real robotic hardware via APIs like ROS MoveIt! or low-level hardware drivers.

### Extensions
Integration with Real Hardware:
- Replace simulated methods with actual robotic hardware drivers using ROS, MoveIt!, or similar frameworks.

Advanced Control Models:
- Use predictive control models (e.g., MPC) for precise trajectory optimization.

Error Recovery:
- Implement retry mechanisms and fallback strategies for failed movements.

Environment Interaction:
- Add collision detection and avoidance during movement execution.
