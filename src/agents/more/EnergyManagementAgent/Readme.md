1. Battery Monitoring
- Monitors battery status in real-time and provides alerts for low or critical battery levels.
- Ensures system safety by triggering charging protocols when necessary.
2. Predictive Modeling
- Estimates remaining runtime based on current energy consumption rates.
- Enables proactive task adjustments to avoid mid-task shutdowns.
3. Energy Usage Optimization
- Adjusts task parameters (e.g., speed, priority) based on battery status.
- Supports energy-efficient task execution under low-battery conditions.
4. Energy Usage Logging and Analysis
- Logs energy consumption for each task to identify high-energy operations.
- Provides analytical summaries for historical energy usage, supporting optimization decisions.
5. Charging Management
- Simulates charging behavior and ensures the battery is fully replenished.
- Provides updates during the charging process for user transparency.
