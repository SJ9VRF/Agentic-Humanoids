1. Agent Registration
- Maintains a registry of all available agents (e.g., sensory, manipulation, planning).
- Enables dynamic assignment of tasks to the appropriate agent.
  
2. Task Parsing
Uses NLP parsing to break down high-level user commands into discrete, actionable subtasks.
Subtasks are prioritized and queued based on their importance.

3. Dynamic Task Prioritization
Implements a priority queue to manage tasks dynamically.
Reassesses priorities in real time based on environmental changes or task urgency.

4. Workflow Execution
Delegates tasks to registered agents in a step-by-step manner.
Ensures that tasks are executed in order of priority, allowing for dynamic reordering if needed.

5. Agent Monitoring
Monitors the operational status of all registered agents.
Provides a robust mechanism for diagnosing issues with agents before or during execution.

## Extensions
Learning-Based Task Scheduling:
Integrate reinforcement learning to optimize task prioritization dynamically based on historical performance.
Fault Tolerance:
Implement fallback mechanisms if an agent fails to complete its assigned task.
Multi-Robot Coordination:
Extend the system to manage tasks across multiple robots, ensuring collaborative workflows.
NLP Enhancements:
Use advanced NLP models like GPT-4 or T5 for more sophisticated command parsing and context understanding.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Add live monitoring tools (e.g., dashboards) for better visualization of agent statuses and task progress.
