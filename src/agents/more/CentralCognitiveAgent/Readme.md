Extensions
Learning-Based Task Scheduling:
Integrate reinforcement learning to optimize task prioritization dynamically based on historical performance.
Fault Tolerance:
Implement fallback mechanisms if an agent fails to complete its assigned task.
Multi-Robot Coordination:
Extend the system to manage tasks across multiple robots, ensuring collaborative workflows.
NLP Enhancements:
Use advanced NLP models like GPT-4 or T5 for more sophisticated command parsing and context understanding.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Add live monitoring tools (e.g., dashboards) for better visualization of agent statuses and task progress.
