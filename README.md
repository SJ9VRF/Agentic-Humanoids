# System Overview

The humanoid robot functions as a multi-agent system where each component acts as an autonomous agent. Each agent has:

- **Goals**: Defined objectives based on the current task.
- **Capabilities**: Specialized skills or resources for completing subtasks.
- **Communication**: Ability to collaborate with other agents and the central control system.

## Core Components of the Agentic Workflow

### 1. Central Cognitive Agent
- **Role**: Acts as the command center.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **NLP Command Parsing**: Breaks down user instructions into subtasks.
  - **Task Prioritization**: Decides the sequence of subtasks based on goals, time constraints, and resources.
  - **Context Understanding**: Uses memory and real-time inputs to adapt decisions.
  - **Delegation**: Assigns tasks to specific agents (robot subsystems).

### 2. Sensory Agents
- **Agents**: Vision, audio, touch, and other sensors.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Data Collection**: Gather environmental data (e.g., detect objects, listen to commands, sense obstacles).
  - **Real-Time Feedback**: Continuously provide updates to the Central Cognitive Agent for decision-making.
  - **Error Detection**: Identify discrepancies (e.g., object not found, incorrect grasp).

### 3. Motor Control Agents
- **Agents**: Arms, legs, torso, and head subsystems.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Precision Control**: Execute movements with fine motor skills (e.g., picking up objects, walking).
  - **Adaptive Movement**: Adjust movement paths dynamically based on real-time sensory feedback.
  - **Energy Optimization**: Use efficient strategies to conserve power during movement.

### 4. Planning and Navigation Agent
- **Role**: Manages pathfinding and movement coordination.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Dynamic Path Planning**: Chart routes to avoid obstacles and optimize travel time.
  - **Localization**: Use SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to understand and map the environment.
  - **Safety Compliance**: Ensure the robot maintains balance and avoids unsafe paths.

### 5. Manipulation Agent
- **Role**: Manages interaction with objects and tools.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Object Recognition**: Identify objects to interact with based on sensory input.
  - **Tool Usage**: Perform complex tasks requiring tool handling (e.g., using a screwdriver).
  - **Grasp Planning**: Choose optimal grip strategies for different object shapes and weights.

### 6. Energy Management Agent
- **Role**: Monitors and manages power consumption.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Battery Monitoring**: Track energy levels and predict depletion time.
  - **Task Prioritization**: Delay non-essential tasks during low energy states.
  - **Self-Charging**: Navigate to charging stations autonomously when necessary.

### 7. Learning Agent
- **Role**: Continuously improves the robot’s performance over time.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimize actions based on trial-and-error feedback.
  - **Human Feedback**: Integrate corrections and suggestions into future actions.
  - **Knowledge Transfer**: Share learned skills across similar tasks.

### 8. Communication Agent
- **Role**: Handles all verbal and non-verbal communication.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Natural Language Processing**: Understand and respond to user commands.
  - **Gesture Recognition**: Interpret and respond to human gestures.
  - **Status Updates**: Provide progress reports during task execution.

## Agentic Workflow in Action

Let’s go through an example where the robot receives the command:  
**“Fetch the red cup from the kitchen and bring it to me.”**

### 1. Command Interpretation (Central Cognitive Agent)
- **NLP Parsing**: Decomposes the command:
  - Task 1: Identify the red cup in the kitchen.
  - Task 2: Pick up the red cup.
  - Task 3: Bring it to the user.

### 2. Task Delegation
The Central Cognitive Agent assigns subtasks:
- **Sensory Agent**: Locate the red cup.
- **Planning and Navigation Agent**: Chart the path to the kitchen.
- **Manipulation Agent**: Pick up the cup.
- **Motor Control Agent**: Walk back and deliver the cup.

### 3. Execution and Feedback Loops
Each agent operates autonomously but communicates with others for coordination:
- **Sensory Agent**:
  - Scans the environment using vision to identify the red cup.
  - Sends the object’s location to the Navigation Agent.
- **Planning and Navigation Agent**:
  - Plans a collision-free route to the kitchen.
  - Continuously updates the path based on sensor feedback (e.g., obstacle detected).
- **Manipulation Agent**:
  - Calculates the best grip for the cup.
  - Verifies grip success via tactile feedback.
- **Motor Control Agent**:
  - Executes walking motions to the user’s location.
  - Adapts movements if balance issues are detected.

### 4. Learning and Adaptation
If the task fails (e.g., the cup is dropped), the Learning Agent refines the Manipulation Agent’s grip strategy.  
The robot stores this experience in memory for future improvement.

## Key Advantages of This System
- **Autonomy**: Each agent independently handles its domain, reducing central bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: New capabilities can be added as agents without overhauling the system.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Feedback loops ensure tasks are dynamically adjusted.
- **Continuous Learning**: Knowledge grows over time, enhancing task performance.
